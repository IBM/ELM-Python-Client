# RM-specific example of creating/removing a link, in this case between two core artifacts in the same project/component/configuration (hardcoded for simplicity)
# If the link is already present it is removed, otherwise it is created
# Link constraints are NOT handled, so if any exist and the new link conflicts with these there will be an error when trying to create the link!
# if your configuration requires changesets you'll have to set the hardcoded configuration to the changeset name and changes will be in that changeset.

# Provide on the commandline the id of the From artifact, the name of the link type (encloised with " if it contains space), and the id of the To artifact
# these must exist in the hardcoded project/config (i.e. within one component)

# NOTE this example isn't as simple as some of the others because of the added complexity of handling RDF XML - it uses the rdfxml library from elemclient

# Steps are:
# Find the link type
# Use OSLC Query to find the FROM artifact - filter the results to determine the core artifact
# Use OSLC Query again, to find the TO artifact - filter the results to determine the core artifact
# GET the from artifact
# check for the link already existing:
#   if present, remove it
#   if not present, add it

# Tested using 7.0.2SR1 (only) - don't know a reason it shouldn't work for earlier versions :-)

# In DN (and ELM) there are what I'd describe as threee types of link type;
# * OSLC links - these always have predefined source and target applications, and predefined URIs - see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/elm/7.0.2?topic=services-links-across-oslc-domains
# * System-deined link types - e.g. Mitigates, Elaborates, these always have predefined URIs and are present and available in every DN project/component
# * Custom link types - these are *always* within an application such as DN or EWM - if to be used between components must be defined in both components, AND you MUST you define the RDF URI with the type definition in each component

# Link types available are discovered when loading the type system from a component+configuration; all the available link types are referenced on each Artifact Type
# this is handled in the rm typesystem loading code which now understands link typesT# 
# Discovery of link types for other applications hasn't been implemented (yet)
