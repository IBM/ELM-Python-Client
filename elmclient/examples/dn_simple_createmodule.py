# example of creating a core artifact
# provide on the commandline (each surrounded by " if it contains a space):
#  The name of the artifact type - case sensitive!
#  Some initial text to put in the artifact
#  The name of the folder where the artifact will be created - this is the path starting with / - case sensitive!

# See section 2 of https://jazz.net/library/article/1197

# to create an artifact you have to find the creation factory
# and find the 'instanceShape' for the type of artifact you want to create
# then you POST some basic content compliant with the shape to the factory URL
# this must also specify the folder where you want the artifact to be created - which means you need to find the folder URL
# folders are found using a OSLC Query capability for folders - this returns one level at a time
# so will likely need a series of queries to find an existing folder
